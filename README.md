# Task Manager

A professional task management application with calendar integration, custom lists, and OAuth2 authentication support.

## Features

- ✅ Task creation and management with priorities and states
- 📅 Calendar integration for task scheduling
- 📋 Custom lists for organizing tasks
- ⏱️ Time tracking for tasks
- 🔐 OAuth2 authentication (Google, GitHub, Authentik)
- 🎨 Modern, responsive UI

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+

### Building the Application

```bash
cd scripts
python3 compile.py --action deploy
```

This will create a `TaskManager.zip` file containing the complete deployment package.

### Running the Application

1. Extract the deployment package:
```bash
unzip TaskManager.zip
cd task-manager
```

2. Configure the application (see [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md))

3. Start the application:
```bash
cd bin
python3 start.py --start-all
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080

## Configuration

The application uses a professional configuration system with separate files for backend, frontend, and web server.

See the [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed information on:
- Application settings
- OAuth2 provider setup
- Frontend configuration
- Web server customization
- Deployment best practices

## Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Don't forget to create a `client/public/config.js` file for development (see template in `scripts/config_templates/config.template.js`).

## Security

### Generating JWT Keys

The application uses RSA keys for JWT token signing:

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out src/main/resources/keys/private_key.pem 2048

# Generate public key
openssl rsa -in src/main/resources/keys/private_key.pem -pubout -out src/main/resources/keys/public_key.pem
```

## Docker Build

Build the application using Docker:

```bash
docker build -f scripts/Dockerfile.build -t fiopans1/taskmanager-compilation:alpha .
docker run -v /path/to/output:/output fiopans1/taskmanager-compilation:alpha
```

## Architecture

- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3.x with Spring Security, JPA, and OAuth2
- **Frontend:** React 18 with Redux Toolkit, React Router, and Bootstrap
- **Database:** SQLite (can be configured for other databases)
- **Web Server:** Caddy server for serving frontend SPA

## Upgrading from Environment Variables

If you're upgrading from a version that used `REACT_APP_*` environment variables, the new configuration system provides better flexibility:

- **No rebuild required** for configuration changes
- **Single deployment artifact** works in multiple environments
- **Runtime configuration** loaded from `config.js`

See the [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for migration details.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Kill process on port 8080 (backend)
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:8080)

# Kill process on port 3000 (frontend)
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000)
```

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

Check `conf/config.js` and ensure `api.baseUrl` matches your backend URL.

### OAuth2 Issues

Ensure both backend (`config/application.properties`) and frontend (`conf/config.js`) have matching OAuth2 settings enabled.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
1. Code follows existing style conventions
2. All tests pass
